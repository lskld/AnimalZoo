# AnimalZoo

This project is a C# console application created as a school assignment to practice object-oriented programming (OOP), with a focus on inheritance. The program is designed to model animals in a zoo using classes and demonstrates how properties and methods can be shared and extended through inheritance.

## Assignment Overview

- **Base Class:** The program features a base class called `Animal` with at least five common properties and three shared methods for all animals.
- **Inheritance:** At least three animal classes inherit from `Animal`, each adding their own unique property and method, along with default values.
- **Polymorphism:** All animals implement a `MakeSound()` method that outputs their specific sound to the console.
- **Constructors:** Each class includes a constructor for creating new animal instances.
- **Multi-level Inheritance:** One animal class is further divided into two subclasses, each with unique features or method overrides.
- **Main Method:** The `Main` method creates several animal objects and demonstrates their sounds in the console.

## Purpose

This project is made for educational purposes, specifically to help me learn and apply object-oriented programming concepts in C#. The code is public for review and feedback.
